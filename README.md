## 📊💡 Data Analytics Journey: Uncovering Customer Behavior and Driving E-commerce Growth with Power BI 🛍️💻

During the Dashboarding Week at the Data Analytics Bootcamp with Le Wagon, I worked on a Power BI project for an e-commerce company specializing in selling necklaces online.

As a **data analyst**, my objective was to analyze the available data and gain insights into `customer behavior on the company's website`🔍.


#### To begin the project:
* I imported multiple data sources into Power BI
* Consolidating the relevant columns into a single table
* After loading the dataset, I started the visualizations and dashboarding to create meaningful charts and visual representations of the data.
